## Contributing

### Adding new Charts

In order to add a new chart to this repository, add the desired repository and the corresponding chart-path to [upstream_charts.json](./conf.d/upstream_charts.json).  
On push to the `master`-branch the [release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) will automagically update the charts.

### Updating Charts

Unfortunately Github-Workflows are not capable of getting triggered manually.  
Therefore, the `release`-workflow is triggered on schedule every 15th minute: `*/15 * * * *`

In case you need an immediate update of the charts in this repository, this `curl` is for you:

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://api.github.com/repos/mittwald/helm-charts/dispatches' \
-u ${GITHUB_USERNAME}:${GITHUB_PASSWORD_OR_API_KEY} \
-d '{"event_type": "updateCharts"}'
```
